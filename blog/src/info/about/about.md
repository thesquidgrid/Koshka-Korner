Strawberry Starter is an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) blog template that came about as I was thinking about the recent push towards personal websites. There's been growing sentiment in my corner of the internet that social media is bad; that that we should ditch it in favor of blogs and personal homepages, but... there's not many great options out there if you're a beginner to HTML/CSS/JS!

Lately I've been doing a lot of dev, and decided I could put some of my knowledge to work, adding to the pool of available resources.

My hope for this template is that someone with little experience can download and use it, and that it'll spur them towards a path of learning about HTML and CSS!

    - Zonelets is a huge inspiration to me! Part of my design goal for Strawberry Starter was basically "Zonelets but without needing to write HTML".

    - Finally, static site generation that's good! This is the most intuitive SSG I've used and it has totally rekindled my love for webdev.
