### My Idea:
- online bookshelf :D

### How I Plan To Execute It:
- use Eleventy to generate html websites for each book i read - each review will be put in mark down format (optional project, using php to make a fillable form with php to generate md text to then be generated into html format)

- Learn more Node.js. Until using strawberry starter, i had no interest in node.js. Now i see how powerful it is and it makes me so so so excited. 

### Interaction and Viewing:
- each time i generate a book review, a new "book" will fill the bookshelf. to view a review, a user must click on a bookshelf to view the review
- the html will be shown in a iframe on the right side of the webpage. i have not thought in depth about viewing on mobile, however it is my goal to make all my webpages look nice and usable on mobile. On mobile, i think it would be nice to have a sort of "small sample" of my most recent books so that users may still be able to read the reviews. 
- there will be an index of all the reviews that will be linked in a notification at the top of the website, where each review is listed by recent-ness. 
    - **Optional**? : add another index sorting reviews by author last name
        - **Optional** **Optional**? : add another index sorting reviews by publication date of book
