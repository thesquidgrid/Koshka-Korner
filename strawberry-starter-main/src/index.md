## Features:
- Write locally, on your computer!
    - All you need is a terminal & your favorite text editor
    - See your changes in realtime with a local web server!
- No HTML experience necessary!
    - Posts are written in Markdown, a really intuitive format
    - Only edit HTML if you really want to
- One-command upload to [Neocities](https://neocities.org/)
    - Upload directly to a site or to a subdirectory


### That sounds awesome!
I think so, too! If you want to get started, you can read the [installation guide](posts/example_posts/installation), but feel free to click around and explore instead. If you're wondering why this site is structured like a blog, it's because it *is* the template! Neat, huh?
